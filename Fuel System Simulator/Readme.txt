Description:

The purpose of this program is to simulate a Fuel System. This simulation has
a dynamic components, such as a speedometer, a wheel, a fuel tank, buttons to 
increase and drecrease the speed of the wheel and to fill the fuel tank and 
finally a rotation counter. The system performance is 10 rpl (rotations per 
liter) and it rotation counter goes from 0 to 9999999.
